// Correcting a beat grid by hand, as a CDJ-3000's Grid Adjust mode does.
// Pure: no JUCE, testable. A grid is beats at firstBeat + n * 60 / bpm, and
// the bar counts from firstBeat: that beat is the downbeat (1 of 4).
//
// Every edit keeps the result's firstBeat in [0, one bar), moved by whole
// bars, so the downbeat it defines stays where it is.

	// into the grid. The smaller way round: at most half a beat.
