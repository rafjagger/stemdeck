// Where everything on the main surface sits (the "clean surface", 2026-10-08).
// Pure: no JUCE, so the geometry can be tested at the rig's 768 x 1024 -- and
// at any other size -- without a window. The components call these with
// their own bounds and apply the result (SurfaceJuce.h converts);
// MainComponent places the sections and the band, whose parts belong to the
// decks and the mixer.
//
// Responsive: every size and gap is a share of what it hangs on -- the
// window, a section, a tile -- never a pixel count.
